RECENT CHANGE LOG
Version 2.2.3 (by SimonIllyan 2018-09-02)
	- /f5housing on|off now reloads UI by itself
	- favourites, aliases and the status of /f5housing are now account-wide (shared by all characters),
	  recents are still per character

Version 2.2.2 (by SimonIllyan 2018-08-24)
	- Fixed sorting of zone names beginning with "The" ("The" should be ignored)
	- Fixed reverse alphabetical sorting

Version 2.2.1 (by SimonIllyan 2018-08-20)
	- Fixed alliance icons in Wayshrines tab
	- "/agoto" output is now sorted by value
	- When /f5housing is set to off, recents list is not being updated;
	  as an interim solution it is hidden from view as well.

Version 2.2.0 (by SimonIllyan 2018-08-19)
	- /agoto without arguments now lists existing aliases, "/agoto key" removes an alias for "key"
	- Added predefined aliases for ambiguous zone names
	- Added "/f5housing on|off" command to dynamically enable/disable WfD's fix for house preview.
	  This fix, unfortunately, has a side effect - cancelling a teleport must be done TWICE.
	  Some people find it annoying, so now it is possible to switch it off and on;
	  "/reloadui" is REQUIRED afterwards.
